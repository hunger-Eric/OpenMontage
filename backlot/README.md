# Backlot — the living storyboard

A read-only local board that shows a production happening: pipeline stages
lighting up, the script as a screenplay page, the scene plan as a filmstrip
that fills in as assets generate, decisions, spend, and activity — all
derived from what the pipeline already writes to `projects/<id>/`.

Canonical `lib.checkpoint.init_project` calls automatically start the server and
open the project's browser page, including continuation calls. Custom project
roots remain quiet unless `open_board=True`; `open_board=False` explicitly opts
out. An already initialized project can be reopened with the CLI below. Startup
failure never prevents production, and the URL remains available for manual
opening. The server binds only to this computer's loopback interface.

```bash
python -m backlot open <project-id>   # start server if needed + open browser
python -m backlot open                # library view (all projects)
python -m backlot serve --port 4750   # run the server in the foreground
```

## How it stays live

No agent involvement. A `watchfiles` watcher on `projects/` publishes change
notifications over SSE; the browser refetches board state. State sources:

| Board element | Disk source |
|---|---|
| identity / rail order | `project.json` + `pipeline_defs/<type>.yaml` |
| stage states, gates, versions | `checkpoint_<stage>.json` + `history/` |
| script card / modal | `artifacts/script.json` |
| filmstrip cards | `scene_plan × script × asset_manifest` join |
| generating shimmer, activity | `events.jsonl` (written by `BaseTool` instrumentation) |
| cost meter | checkpoint `cost_snapshot` |
| renders | `renders/*.mp4` (+ root-level mp4 heuristic) |

Projects without checkpoints degrade gracefully to a "what the watcher
found" view — media, snapshots, renders.

**Replay**: a completed run can be scrubbed end-to-end (▶ REPLAY RUN on the
board) — reconstructed from checkpoint history and event timestamps.

Try it without a real production:

```bash
python scripts/backlot_simulate_run.py          # live demo run (~1 min)
python -m backlot open backlot-demo-run
```
